# Contributing Guideline

- First, and the most importent one, make sure you read the [README.md file](README.md).
- Read the [issues](https://github.com/wevisdemo/parliament-watch/issues) carefully, comment on the issue that you want to work and we will assign you to that issue.
- For external collaborator (don't have a permission to write on a main branch)
  - For each issue, create a new branch name in the format of `username/issuenumber-description`.
  - Open the pull requests (PR), with the same name of the issue.
    - If not ready for a review, please put `[WIP]` in front of the title.
- For internal collaborator (have a permission to write on a main branch)

  - Can work on the main branch for fast code integration (CI)
  - Add issue number as a commit message scope eg. `feat(issuenumber): commit description`.

- Questions and discussion can be done on the Github's issue or PR in English or Thai (choose the one you are comfortable).

Thank you and enjoy coding!
